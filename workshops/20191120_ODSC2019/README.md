## Running the notebooks

The notebooks can be run either with a conda environment or using docker.  
Either way, follow the general [README.md](../../README.md) and see the respective section below for details concerning the workshop.

### Conda

Depending from where you start the `jupyter notebook` server you might have do minor adjustments to relative paths in notebooks from `workshops/20191120_ODSC2019/notebooks`.

### Docker

With the docker setup we mount a different directory.  
```docker run --mount src=`pwd`/workshops/20191120_ODSC2019/notebooks,target=/workspace/notebooks,type=bind -p 8899:8888 -it drugilsberg/depiction```

and start your browser at [http://localhost:8899/tree/notebooks](http://localhost:8899/tree/notebooks)
